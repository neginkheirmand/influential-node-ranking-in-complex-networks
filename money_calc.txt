lets say kit takes us another 6 days
with 3 machines

if we go with the 1 core plan  every day is 16
5*3*16 = 240
6*3*16 = 288


as of right now lets think we have somewhere between 5 to 6 days and this plan will work out. 
I readlly do hope  wont have to come back here and do more money related calculations.
